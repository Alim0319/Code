          Software Testing is about looking at a product from different angles,
          with different perspectives and testing it with different
          expectations. And it is an enjoyable job for me because it is a
          primary role for the client and end-users. I am very passionate about
          helping others to make sure their product has top quality, bug-free.
          Quality improvement with creating or building a bug-free application
          and end-user satisfaction motivates me to develop with software
          testing.
